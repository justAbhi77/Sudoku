# Sudoku
This repository is a helper gui for understanding a sudoku puzzle.

# Explanation
There are 9 possibilities of each cell(1 to 9) each. As the user clicks each possible nuber for a cell, the row,column and grid coresponding to the cell is changed to reflect the users choice(the user can also make an impossible move which makes a cell devoid of any possible value).
This is just a visualizer for sudoku not a solver.
